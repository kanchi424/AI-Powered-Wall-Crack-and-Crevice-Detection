# AI-Powered-Wall-Crack-and-Crevice-Detection

This project tries to address the problem of detecting cracks manually by humans. Instead this project aims to use a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) model to automatically detects major cracks or crevices in any wall .Developed a machine learning model to detect and classify cracks and crevices in walls using computer vision techniques. The project aimed to automate the identification of structural issues in buildings, providing a reliable and efficient solution for maintenance and inspection tasks.

Key Responsibilities:

Data Preparation: Managed a dataset consisting of 20,000 cracked and 20,000 uncracked images. Preprocessed the data by splitting it into training, validation, and testing sets to ensure robust model performance.

Model Development: Utilized TensorFlow and Keras to design and train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. The model was fine-tuned to accurately distinguish between cracked and uncracked wall surfaces.

Model Evaluation: Conducted extensive validation and testing to ensure the model's accuracy and generalization capabilities. Achieved high precision and recall rates in detecting cracks and crevices.

Deployment: Implemented the trained model in a real-time environment using OpenCV for live detection of cracks. The model was optimized for deployment on a Jetson Nano, leveraging GPU acceleration to enhance processing speed.

Model Persistence: Developed scripts to save and load the trained model, facilitating easy deployment and future use without retraining.

Technologies Used: Python, TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, Jetson Nano, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Image Processing.
